looking at ~/Development/goose latest branch changes it has some code ot detect recently changed dirs. 

Inspired by that (but not copy) - i want that in here in this project: 

* when started, it looks for recently touched things on users system, if a file or dir, then walk up until you see a .git, if it has a .git, then that is a possible dir the user may want to open instead of the file selector
*
